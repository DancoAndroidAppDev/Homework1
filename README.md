Homework1
=========
Hello class, During wk2's lesson, we discussed layouts on Android. You were introduced to Views and ViewGroups. 
Specifically, we saw LinearLayouts and RelativeLayouts. For this homework, build an Activity that draws four 
shapes (rectangles or squares) on the screen. The shapes must be arranged in pairs, one pair placed directly 
underneath the other. Within each pair, place the shapes side by side. You may use either LinearLayouts, 
RelativeLayouts, or a combination of both. Additionally, give each shape a different color. You may also use a 
combination of squares and rectangles. Feel free to be creative. The goal of this homework is to get you familiar 
with view placements, using the XML attributes of the layouts.
